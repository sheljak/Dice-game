- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his round score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his round score gets added to his global score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on global score wins the game
